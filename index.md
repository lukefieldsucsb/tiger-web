## Hello and Welcome to My Website!

My name is Luke Fields. I am an Undergraduate Statistics and Data Science student at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). I have a passion for the world of numbers and data, but also a fantastic enthusiasm for other things that life has to offer. Not only does this website serve as a platform for others to view numerous projects of mine, but it also is my medium to talk about the world of sports, nature, food, and any other facets of life I wish to share my thoughts on. I hope you enjoy anything you come across, and feel free to reach out to me!
